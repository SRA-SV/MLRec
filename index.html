									<h2>MLRec 2016</h2>
									<p>2<sup>nd</sup> International Workshop on Machine Learning Methods for Recommender Systems</p>
								</header>
								<p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm15/" target="blank">16th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2016)</a><br />
								      May, 2016, Miami, Florida, USA</b></p>

								<p>Following the success of <a href="http://mlrec.org/2015/">the last edition of MLRec</a>, this second edition focuses on applying novel as well as existing machine learning and data mining methodologies for improving recommender systems. There are many established conferences such as NIPS and ICML that focus on the study of theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, the recent developed conference ACM RecSys focuses on different aspects of designing and implementing recommender systems. We believe that there is a gap between these two ends, and this workshop aims at bridging the recent advances of machine learning and data mining algorithms to improving recommender systems. Since many recommendation approaches are built upon data mining and machine learning algorithms, these approaches are deeply rooted in their foundations. As such, there is an urgent need for researchers from the two communities to jointly work on 1) what are the recent developed machine learning and data mining techniques that can be leveraged to address challenges in recommender systems, and 2) from challenges in recommender systems, what are the practical research directions in the machine learning and data mining community.</p>

								<h4>Topics of Interest</h4>
								<p>We encourage submissions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:</p>
								<ul class="feature-icons2">
								<li class="fa-lightbulb-o">Novel machine learning algorithms for recommender systems, e.g., new content/context aware recommendation algorithms, new algorithms for matrix factorization handling cold-start items, tensor-based approach for recommender systems, and etc. </li>
								<li class="fa-paper-plane">Novel approaches for applying existing machine learning algorithms, e.g., applying bilinear models, (non-convex) sparse learning, metric learning, low-rank approximation/PCA/SVD, neural networks and deep learning, for recommender systems. </li>
								<li class="fa-rocket">Novel optimization algorithms and analysis for improving recommender systems, e.g., parallel/distributed optimization techniques and efficient stochastic gradient descent. </li>
								<li class="fa-gears">Industrial practices and implementations of recommendation systems, e.g., feature engineering, model ensemble, and lessons from large-scale implementations of recommender systems.</li>
								<li class="fa-lock">Machine learning methods for security and privacy aware recommendations, user-centric recommendations with emphasize on users’ interaction and engagement, Explore-Exploit approach, multi-armed bandits for recommendation, and etc.</li>
