	      <p>3<sup>rd</sup> International Workshop on Machine Learning Methods for Recommender Systems</p>

	    <p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm17/" target="blank">17th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2017)</a><br />
		April 27 - 29, 2017, Houston, Texas, USA</b></p>
	    
	    <p>Following the success of the last editions of MLRec in
	      <a href="http://mlrec.org/2015/">2015</a> and
	      <a href="http://mlrec.org/2016/">2016</a>,
	      the third edition of the MLRec workshop focuses on developing novel, and applying existing
	      Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) methods to improve recommender systems.
	      This workshop also highly encourages applying ML-based recommendation
	      algorithms in novel application domains (e.g., precision medicine), and 
	      solving novel recommendation problems formulated from industry.   
	      
	      
	      The ultimate goal of the 
	      MLRec workshop series is to promote the advancement and implementation of
	      new, effective and efficient ML and DM techniques with high translational potential
	      for real and large-scale recommender systems,
	      and to expand the territory of ML-based recommender system research toward non-conventional
	      application areas where recommendation problems largely exist but haven't been fully
	      recognized.

	      <!--
	      There are many established conferences such as NIPS and ICML that focus on the study of theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, the recent developed conference ACM RecSys focuses on different aspects of designing and implementing recommender systems. We believe that there is a gap between these two ends, and this workshop aims at bridging the recent advances of machine learning and data mining algorithms to improving recommender systems. Since many recommendation approaches are built upon data mining and machine learning algorithms, these approaches are deeply rooted in their foundations. As such, there is an urgent need for researchers from the two communities to jointly work on 1) what are the recent developed machine learning and data mining techniques that can be leveraged to address challenges in recommender systems, and 2) from challenges in recommender systems, what are the practical research directions in the machine learning and data mining community.

			      <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will present the Dueling Bandits Problem, which is an online learning framework tailored towards real-time learning from subjective human feedback. In particular, the Dueling Bandits Problem only requires pairwise comparisons, which are shown to be reliably inferred in a variety of subjective feedback settings such as for information retrieval and recommender systems. I will provide an overview of the Dueling Bandits Problem with basic algorithmic results. I will then conclude by discussing some ongoing research directions with applications to personalized medicine.

			      <b>Julian McAuley</b>, University of California, San Diego <br /> 
			      <b>Title:</b> Harnessing reviews to build richer models of opinions <br /> 
			      <b>Abstract:</b> Online reviews are often our first port of call when considering products and purchases online. Yet navigating huge volumes of reviews (many of which we might disagree with) is laborious, especially when we are interested in some niche aspect of a product. This suggests a need to build models that are capable of capturing the complex and idiosyncratic semantics of reviews, in order to build richer and more personalized recommender systems. In this talk I'll discuss three such directions: First, how can reviews be harnessed to better understand the dimensions (or facets) of people's opinions? Second, how can reviews be used to answer targeted questions, that may be subjective or require personalized responses? And third, how can reviews themselves be synthesized, so as to predict what a reviewer would say, even for products they haven't seen yet?	<br /> 
			      <b>Bio: </b> Julian McAuley’s research focuses on the linguistic, temporal, and visual dimensions of opinions and behavior in social networks and online communities. This includes understanding the facets of people's opinions, the processes by which people "acquire tastes" for gourmet foods and beers, or even the visual dimensions that make clothing items compatible. He has been an assistant professor at UC San Diego since 2014, and received his PhD from the Australian National University. </p>

			      <b>Hanghang Tong</b>, Arizona State University <br /> 
			      <b>Title:</b> Towards Optimal Teams in Big Networks <br /> 
			      <b>Abstract:</b> In his world-widely renowned book “The Science of the Artificial”, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon pointed out that it is more the complexity of the environment, than the complexity of the individual persons, that determines the complex behavior of humans. The emergence of network science and the advent of big data, provides a new environment/context, where people interact and collaborate with each other to collectively perform some complex tasks. In this talk, we will summarize our recent effort on analyzing team performance in the context of big networks. First (characterization): we will present our findings on what kinds of network metrics/characteristics are crucial to team performance, and to what extent. Second (prediction): we will present predictive models to forecast the performance of a given team at an early stage, based on its network structure. Finally (enhancement): we will present tools and algorithms to enhance the performance of an existing team. <br /> 
			      <b>Bio: </b> Hanghang Tong is currently an assistant professor at School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE), Arizona State University.  Before that, he was an assistant professor at Computer Science Department, City College, City University of New York, a research staff member at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and a Post-doctoral fellow in Carnegie Mellon University. He received his M.Sc and Ph.D. degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 2008 and 2009, both majored in Machine Learning. His research interest is in large scale data mining for graphs and multimedia.
